# CogniRank Cognitive Deconstruction Quality Assessment Guide

This guide defines and quantifies the quality of outputs for each Set (Si) in the CogniRank Matrix.  
The Quality Score (Quality(Si)) uses a 1–5 scale, where **5 represents the highest quality**.

## I. Core Assessment Dimensions

All Set evaluations are based on the following four interconnected dimensions:

| Dimension | Definition | Core Question |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Depth** | The level of inquiry and penetrative power into the topic. Avoid staying on the surface or common knowledge. | Does the output penetrate to the core mechanisms and underlying logic? |
| **Breadth** | The scope and diversity of perspectives covered. Does it comprehensively consider all relevant Sets? | Does the result cover all critical sub-dimensions and relevant perspectives of the question? |
| **Consistency** | Whether the internal logic of the output is self-consistent, non-contradictory, and aligned with the problem context (C Set). | Are there any logical conflicts or inconsistencies among the different elements of the analysis? |
| **Actionability** | Can the output directly guide the next step of action, decision-making, or deeper thinking? | Is the result purely descriptive, or does it propose verifiable hypotheses or actionable solutions? |

## II. Quality Scoring Criteria

The final **Quality(Si)** score for each Set is based on the assessment of the four dimensions above  
(initially set as a simple average).

| Score | Quality Description | Typical Performance |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **5: Excellent** | **Breakthrough Insight.** High depth, broad coverage, perfect consistency, and provides direct critical decision guidance. | Successfully challenged a core belief in A (Assumption Set) and discovered novel G (Mechanism Set) variables. |
| **4: Strong** | **Solid and Comprehensive.** Sufficient depth, complete coverage, rigorous logic, and conclusions have strong guiding significance. | Clearly defined D (Definitional Set) and mapped a complete E (Connectivity Set) graph. |
| **3: Adequate** | **Meets Basic Requirements.** Output content is correct but lacks depth or breadth. Primarily descriptive information. | Accurately addressed C (Contextual Set) but failed to provide dynamic H (Feedback Set) analysis. |
| **2: Developing** | **Preliminary Attempt.** Contains key information, but has obvious omissions (insufficient breadth) or unclear logic (poor consistency). | D (Definitional Set) concepts are vague, or A (Assumption Set) includes only superficial common knowledge. |
| **1: Poor** | **Missing or Invalid.** Output has low relevance to the question or contains serious logical errors. | Feedback from P (Meta-Cognition Set) or Q (Bias Set) is generic or irrelevant to the current thought process. |

## III. Specific Set Quality Emphasis

Certain Sets should receive higher weighting on specific dimensions.  
This table provides guidance for weighted assessment.

| Layer | Key Set | Primary Dimension | Quality Focus Explanation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Layer 3: Dynamic** | **G (Mechanism Set)** | **Depth & Actionability** | Must identify **non-obvious** core drivers and serve as intervention points. |
| **Layer 4: Insight** | **L (Value Set)** | **Breadth & Depth** | Must analyze long-term value and value conflicts across different stakeholders. |
| **Layer 6: Meta** | **P, Q (Meta-Cognition, Bias Sets)** | **Actionability** | Must provide **concrete corrective actions**, not just identify the bias. |
| **Layer 1: Framing** | **A (Assumption Set)** | **Depth & Consistency** | Identified assumptions must be **fundamental** and consistent with the scope (B Set). |
