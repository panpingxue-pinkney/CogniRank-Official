# 12_User_Onboarding_Strategy - User Onboarding and Education Strategy

**Purpose:** Develop a layered onboarding strategy to introduce the CogniRank system to new users without increasing their cognitive load, and encourage high-quality questioning (R Set reinforcing loop).

---

## I. Layered Onboarding Principles

The onboarding strategy must align with CogniRank's six Layers, utilizing a **Disclosure on Demand** approach.

| Level | Target User | Core Concept | Corresponding CogniRank Layer |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **L0: Minimal Launch** | First-time | "Ask a question, get an actionable insight." (Set L). | Layer 4 & 5 (L, O) |
| **L1: Structural Awareness** | Report Viewers | "Your thought was broken down into six dimensions." (6 Layers). | Layer 0, 1, 2 |
| **L2: Mechanism Mastery** | Advanced Optimizers | "Which variables and biases drive your conclusion?" (Set G, Q). | Layer 3 & 6 (G, H, P, Q) |

## II. Detailed Onboarding Flow

### Stage A: The Question Submission UI (Level 0)

* **Strategy:** Minimize input friction, maximize input quality.
* **Implementation:**
    * **Contextual Prompts:** Below the input box, display three guiding questions from  **A**, **B**, **C** Sets (e.g., "What is your **implicit assumption**?"). Filling is optional.
    * **Quality Preview:** Give a **predicted  **I** score** in real-time based on the complexity and length of the text input.
    * **Action Guidance:** Highlight the "Submit" button and promise a "Structured Insight Report in 3 minutes."

### Stage B: The Report Display (Level 1)

* **Strategy:** Start with the macroscopic result (**L**, **I**), and gradually deepen into details (**A**, **B**, **C**...).
* **Implementation:**
    * **Waterfall Structure:** The report first displays **B. Insight Summary** and **C. Quality Dashboard** (highlighting  **I** score and Radar Chart).
    * **Layer Explanation Tab:** Set up Tabs for the six Layers in the sidebar or top navigation. A **Tool-tip popup** should provide a **one-sentence explanation** of the Layer upon clicking.
    * **Color Coding:** Use color coding (e.g., green for high-scoring Sets; yellow for Sets requiring correction  **Q** ) to quickly communicate the quality status **Q(S）_i**).

### Stage C: Advanced Learning & Optimization (Level 2)

* **Strategy:** Provide a learning path that converts complex mechanisms into actionable optimization advice.
* **Implementation:**
    * **"How to Improve  **I** Score" Panel:** Offer **personalized learning paths** based on the output of  **P** and  **Q** Sets. Example: "Your  **A** Set score is too low; please study critical assumption identification."
    * **Mechanism Deep Dive:** Next to  **G** and **H** Sets, provide an **"Understand Mechanism"** button that pops up the Causal Loop Diagram (Wireframe 2) and a simplified whitepaper explanation.
    * **R Set Reinforcement:** Log user **interaction behavior** with the report (clicks, optimization feedback) and count these actions towards their  **R** Set learning points, showing their **continuous cognitive optimization curve**.
