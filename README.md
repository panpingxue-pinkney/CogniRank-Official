## ⚠️ Important License Upgrade Notice (Effective November 20, 2025)

To ensure the project attracts excellent contributors while guaranteeing sustainable development and the deserved rewards for the original author,

this repository will officially adopt the **Business Source License 1.1 (BUSL-1.1)** effective immediately:

- **For the next 4 years (until December 1, 2029)**: Completely free to use, modify, distribute, and even commercially (even more lenient than MIT!)

- **After December 1, 2029**: Automatically converted to GPL; commercial use or SaaS development requires purchasing a commercial license.

- All future commercial revenue will be allocated **20%** as a "Contributor Bonus Pool" to reward active contributors.

The old repository is archived: https://github.com/panpingxue-pinkney/CogniRank The official mainline has been permanently migrated to this repository.

We warmly welcome all enthusiasts to participate in the development.

# 🚀 CogniRank: The Socratic Sequence (Cognitive Rating)

## ✨ Core Manifesto: Answers are Abundant, Questions are Gold.

> **We refuse to be "passive information recipients" in the Age of AI.**

With the proliferation of Large Language Models (LLMs), obtaining answers has become efficient, drastically **devaluing the price of "answers,"** while the **depth and quality of "questions"** stand as humanity's most valuable and scarce asset.

CogniRank is dedicated to building a **Structured Cognitive Deconstruction System** with the core objectives of:

1.  **Quantifying Query Insight:** Translating the critical depth, logical boundaries, and cognitive value of human questions into a machine-parsable **20-Dimensional Matrix**.
2.  **Calibrating AI Model Bias:** Accumulating high-quality, structured "Socratic Sequence" data to train the next generation of AI in enhanced critical reasoning and cognitive calibration.

## 💡 Project Vision: Quantifying the Art of Thinking

The entire CogniRank project revolves around a matrix of **6 Layers** and **20 Cognitive Sets (Z to R)** that meticulously deconstructs any complex input query.

This repository is the **definitive, English-first, open-source standard** for defining, scoring, and implementing this Socratic Sequence.

## ⚙️ Repository Structure (For Global Contributors)

To maximize clarity and minimize cognitive load for new contributors, the project files are organized by functional area. Please explore the directories below based on your area of expertise:

| Folder | Focus Area | Key Documents & Purpose | Target Contributor |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **`/schemas`** | **Data Authority** | `01_CogniRank_Schema.json`, `09_Analysis_Output_Schema.json`: Defines the **20 Sets** structure and the final report output. | Structural Engineering, Data Modeling |
| **`/engineering`** | **Implementation** | `08_Backend_API_Spec.md`, `06_Tooling_Plan.md`, `07_MVP_Workflow_Diagram.md`: Details the execution flow, API, and technology stack for the MVP. | Backend/API Developers, ML Engineers |
| **`/docs`** | **Methodology & UX** | `02_Scoring_Guide.md`, `10_Prompt_Template_Analysis.md`, `11_Client_Display_Wireframe.md`: Explains the scoring rules, prompting strategies, and front-end visualization goals. | Technical Writers, AI/LLM Experts, UX/UI Designers |
| **Root** | **High-Level Strategy** | `README.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`: Core philosophy and contribution guidelines. | All Contributors |

## 🎯 Core Work Goal: Completing the 20-Set Implementation

Our immediate focus is on converting the **structured documentation** within this repository into a **functional, validated MVP**. We invite contributors to help us:

1.  **Validate Schemas & Scores:** Ensure the rules in `/schemas` and `/docs/02_Scoring_Guide.md` are logically consistent and robust.
2.  **Build the Orchestrator:** Implement the core flow described in `/engineering/07_MVP_Workflow_Diagram.md` using the tooling defined in `/engineering/06_Tooling_Plan.md`.
3.  **Refine Prompt Strategies:** Contribute to the advanced prompting logic in `/engineering/10_Prompt_Template_Analysis.md` to ensure high-quality, structured output from LLMs for complex Sets (G, H, P, Q).
